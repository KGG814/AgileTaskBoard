# AgileTaskBoard
This project was assigned to me as part of the interview process at IR (http://www.ir.com/). It involved creating an OO based task board for the Scrum methodology.

Documentation is available in the html folder (You'll have to download it to view it properly).
If you are unfamiliar with Scrum or the Task Board, more info available here: http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/task-boards
